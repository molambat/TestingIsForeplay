**Cypress-driven QA, polished by passion. Nothing flaky allowed.**

Welcome to my personal automation playground — where clean code meets seductive precision.

---

## 🔍 What’s this?

This repo is a curated playground for:

- 🔬 Testing real-world app flows with **Cypress**
- 🧠 Illustrating my **manual QA approach** (test cases, bug reports)
- 📈 Preparing **CI/CD integration** setups (coming soon)

Everything here is crafted from experience in real missions — clean, readable, and focused on what really matters: **reliable software**.

---

## 💚 You’ll find:

- ✅ **Cypress e2e tests** with best practices
- 📝 **Manual test cases** (test ID, steps, expected results,...)
- 🐞 **Bug templates** & reporting structure
- ⏱️ Planned: CI examples using GitHub Actions
- 👀 No bloat, no overengineering — just QA that works.

---

## 💡 Why this name?

Because **good QA is the art of anticipation**:  
You detect the tension before the crash,  
you know exactly where to focus,  
and you never go to production without a little excitement first. 😉
