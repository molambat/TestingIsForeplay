**Cypress-driven QA, polished by passion. Nothing flaky allowed — unless it's intentional. 😉**

Welcome to my personal automation playground — where clean code meets seductive precision.
> Warning: This repo contains explicit attention to detail and intense QA sessions.

## 🔥 Let’s get intimate (with the code)

This repo is a curated playground for:

- 🔬 Testing real-world app flows with **Cypress**
- 🧠 Illustrating my **manual QA approach** (test cases, bug reports)
- 📈 Preparing **CI/CD integration** setups (coming soon)

Everything here is crafted from experience in real missions — clean, readable, and focused on what really matters: **reliable software**.

---

## 💚 You’ll find:

- ✅ **Cypress e2e tests** with best practices 
- 📝 **Manual test cases** (test ID, steps, expected results,...)
- 🐞 **Bug templates** & reporting structure
- ⏱️ Planned: CI examples using GitHub Actions
- 👀 No bloat, no overengineering — just QA that works.

---

## 💡 Why this name?

Because **good QA is the art of anticipation**:  
You detect the tension before the crash,  
you know exactly where to focus,  
you never go to production without a little excitement first. 
And because when foreplay is good, you don’t even need a release note. 😉

## 👩‍💻 About me

I'm a QA Consultant with 6+ years in the field (5 in development, 1+ in QA).
I don’t just automate tests — I craft sensual flows that beg to be executed. 
I build test strategies, set up automation from scratch, and turn messy flows into predictable systems.
I build QA pipelines that purr when triggered, and leave no component untouched.

✨ Fun fact: I also create content on the side — because being serious doesn’t mean being boring.
QA by day, creative troublemaker by night.  
Yes, I read specs — but I also know how to leave the right ports open. 😉
