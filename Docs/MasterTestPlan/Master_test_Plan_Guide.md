**What is a Master Test Plan?**

The **Master Test Plan (MTP)** is a **strategic document** that defines how testing will be conducted in a project. It provides an overview of the testing approach, scope, objectives, environment, and responsibilities. The goal is to establish a clear and structured plan for testing to ensure software quality before deployment.

**Why is a Master Test Plan Important?**

✅ **Defines testing scope**: What is included and excluded.

✅ **Ensures structured test execution**: Organizes tests into phases and priorities.

✅ **Helps communicate with stakeholders**: Provides clarity on testing activities.

✅ **Manages risks**: Identifies potential issues early.

✅ **Improves efficiency**: Ensures all testing efforts align with project goals.

**How to Use the Master Test Plan?**

1. **Project Information** – Fill in the project name, QA responsible, and update date.
2. **Define Testing Objectives** – Clarify what the testing aims to achieve.
3. **Scope of Testing** – Identify what features will be tested and what will not.
4. **Testing Approach** – Specify if tests are manual, automated, functional, performance-based, etc.
5. **Test Environment** – List browsers, devices, operating systems, and infrastructure.
6. **Test Data** – Define how test data is managed and stored.
7. **Test Automation** – Identify which tests are automated and their coverage percentage.
8. **Risks and Assumptions** – Document any risks that could impact testing.
9. **Test Schedule** – Establish testing phases (Unit, Integration, System, UAT, Regression).
10. **Resources & Responsibilities** – Assign team members to roles (QA, Devs, PMs, etc.).
11. **Defect Management** – Define how bugs will be logged, tracked, and resolved.
12. **Exit Criteria** – Specify the conditions required for testing completion.

## Understanding Different Formats

### **📂 Markdown (.md)**

- **Best for:** Documentation on GitHub, GitLab, Confluence, or Notion.
- **Compatible with:** Git repositories, static site generators (Hugo, Jekyll), Notion for structured documentation.
- **Use Case:** Version control and lightweight documentation.

### **📂 CSV (.csv)**

- **Best for:** Importing data into structured databases or spreadsheets.
- **Compatible with:** Excel, Google Sheets, Notion (as a table), Jira for bulk test case imports.
- **Use Case:** Organizing test cases, tracking execution results, filtering test categories.

### **📂 HTML (.html)**

- **Best for:** Web-based reports and interactive test documentation.
- **Compatible with:** Web browsers, internal QA dashboards, automated report generation tools.
- **Use Case:** Creating readable reports for non-technical stakeholders.

### **📂 JSON (.json)**

- **Best for:** Machine-readable formats for automated test execution.
- **Compatible with:** Cypress, Selenium, Postman, Robot Framework.
- **Use Case:** Storing test configurations, API test scenarios, and integrating automated testing tools.

## Tools That Can Be Connected

🔹 **Cypress** – Uses **JSON** for test configurations and automation.

🔹 **Selenium** – Can integrate **CSV/JSON** test data for automated execution.

🔹 **Postman** – Imports **JSON** test cases for API automation.

🔹 **Squash** – Can import **CSV** test plans for structured manual testing.

🔹 **Jira/Xray** – Accepts **CSV** test case imports to track execution.

**Common Questions**

❓ **Does the Master Test Plan include individual test cases?**  
No, the MTP outlines the **overall test strategy**. Test cases are documented separately in a Test Execution Tracker.

❓ **How often should the Master Test Plan be updated?**  
It should be reviewed and updated **at key project milestones** or when significant changes occur.

❓ **Can the MTP be used for automated and manual testing?**  
Yes! It covers both approaches and helps define which parts of the project will be automated.

**Final Notes**

🚀 The **Master Test Plan** is a critical document that ensures testing efforts are well-structured, organized, and aligned with project goals. **Make sure to keep it updated and adapt it to your specific needs!**
