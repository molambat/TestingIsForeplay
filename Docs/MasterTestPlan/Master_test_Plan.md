## ðŸ“„ Notes & Recommendations

- Log **all test execution results**, including failed cases.
- Never delete logs, even if bugs are later fixed â€” theyâ€™re proof of value.
- Always include a **clear disclaimer** if some tests couldn't be run before release.
- Use screenshots, videos, and logs in bug reports.
- Communicate test status and risks **proactively**.

> QA isnâ€™t just about catching bugs â€” itâ€™s about building **trust** through clarity, consistency, and continuous feedback.
